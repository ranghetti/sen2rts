# Build and Analyse Sentinel-2 Time Series

`{sen2rts}` is an R library which helps to extract and manage time series
from Sentinel-2 archives created with the package `{sen2r}`.

This package is currently under development (beta version).

Functionalities currently implemented in the package are summarised below.
A wider overview is presented in the vignette 
["The sen2rts workflows"](articles/workflow.md), which shows a simple,
reproducible use case to obtain a smoothed equally-weighted time series, 
isolate cycles and extract metrics,
explaining how the currently implemented functions can be used to perform a 
common workflow.
For documentation about specific functions, see the [Reference](./reference) page.

## Installation

Currently `{sen2rts}` is not on CRAN; it can be installed from GitHub:
```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ranghetti/sen2rts")
```

In case of troubles related to the installation of `{sen2r}`, whose 
`{sen2rts}` depends, refer to 
[sen2r installation page](https://sen2r.ranghetti.info/articles/installation.html).

## Usage

The following minimal example synthetically shows how to perform the main steps
provided by the package; refer to [this vignette](articles/workflow.md) for a wider explanation.

```{r sample, eval=FALSE}
library(sen2rts)

## Create a Sentinel-2 derived archive using sen2r
#  (see sen2r documentation at https://sen2r.ranghetti.info/ )
#  and read the paths of the raster using function load_s2paths()
#
#  (in this examples, sample data are used)
sen2r_ndvi_paths <- sample_paths("NDVI") # NDVI images (target product)
sen2r_scl_paths <- sample_paths("SCL")   # SCL images (quality flag)

## Extract, smooth and gap fill time series
data("sampleroi") # Sample spatial features for data extraction
ts_raw <- extract_s2ts(sen2r_ndvi_paths, sampleroi, scl_paths = sen2r_scl_paths)
# extract time series over sampleroi extension
ts_smoothed <- smooth_s2ts(ts_raw) # smooth time series
ts_filled <- fill_s2ts(ts_smoothed) # gap filling (daily time series)

## Phenological fitting and extraction
dt_cycles <- cut_cycles(ts_filled) # cut vegetation cycles
cf <- fit_curve(ts_filled, dt_cycles) # fit double logistic curves
dt_pheno <- extract_pheno(cf) # extract phenological metrics

## Plot results
plot(ts_filled, pheno = dt_pheno, plot_points = TRUE)
```
```{r tsfinal, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(sen2rts)
data(ts_filled)
data(dt_pheno)
plot(ts_filled, pheno = dt_pheno, plot_points = TRUE)
```
