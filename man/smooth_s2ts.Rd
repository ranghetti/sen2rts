\usage{
smooth_s2ts(
  ts,
  min_qa = 0.2,
  noise_dir = "low",
  spike = 0.25,
  spike_window = 5,
  sg_daywindow = 15,
  sg_polynom = 2,
  sg_n = 3,
  max_extrapolation = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{Time series in \code{s2ts} format (generated using \code{extract_s2ts()}).}

\item{min_qa}{(optional) minimum 0-1 quality value
(points with \code{qa < min_qa} are not used, while \code{qa} values
in the range \code{min_qa} to 1 are reshaped into the range 0 to 1).
Default is 0.5.}

\item{noise_dir}{Direction of points generally containing noise.
If \code{"low"}, higher values are generally maintained (this is the case of
most vegetation indices like NDVI);
if \code{"high"}, lower values are generally maintained;
if \code{"undefined"} (default), no assumptions are done.}

\item{spike}{Relative "y" difference for spike determination (default is 0.25).
Set to NA to skip spike removal.}

\item{spike_window}{Maximum number of values for spike identification
(it must be an odd number). Default is 3.}

\item{sg_daywindow}{Half-size of the time window to be used to interpolate}

\item{sg_polynom}{Argument \code{polynom} of function \code{w_savgol()}.}

\item{sg_n}{(optional) Positive integer: number of applications of the
Savitzky-Golay filter. The minimum value is 1 (a single application
using the weights included in \code{ts}).
Within each additional application, the weights included in \code{ts} are
multiplicated for the relative ranks of the difference between original
and smoothed values (if \code{noise_dir = "low"}) or between smoothed and
original values (if \code{noise_dir = "high"}).
If \code{noise_dir = "undefined"}, this argument is coerced to 1.}

\item{max_extrapolation}{(optional) Numeric: maximum allowed extrapolation
out of original range (relative value).
Default is 0.1 (+10\%). Set to Inf in order not to set any constraint.}
