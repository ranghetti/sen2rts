\arguments{
\item{pheno}{Cycle allocation (data table generated by \code{extract_pheno()}
or \code{cut_cycles()}).}

\item{seasons}{Character vector with the season names to be used.}

\item{pop}{Vector with the expected dates of cycle peaks (one per season,
it must be of the same length of \code{seasons}), in the form \code{"mm-dd"}
(month-day). If provided, it is used to filter cycles among seasons
(see argument \code{max_n_cycles}).}

\item{pop_win}{List with the allowed ranges for the dates of
cycle peaks (one per season): each element is a two-length character vector
with two elements, in the form \code{"mm-dd"} (month-day), representing the range
of the temporal window (see default value as example) within the
corresponding season. The list must be of the same length of \code{seasons}.
If \code{season} is one-length, \code{pop_seasons} can be also a two-length vector.
Each element of the list can be left to NA in order not to specify any
filtering condition.}

\item{sos_win}{List with the allowed ranges for the dates of
start of cycle (see \code{pop_seasons} for details about the format).}

\item{eos_win}{Named list with the allowed ranges for the dates of
end of cycle (see \code{pop_seasons} for details about the format).}

\item{pop_name}{Character name of the field in \code{pheno} to be used as metric
for the date of peak (associated with \code{pop_seasons}).}

\item{sos_name}{Character name of the field in \code{pheno} to be used as metric
for the date of start of cycle (associated with \code{sos_seasons}).
Set to NULL in order not to apply.}

\item{eos_name}{Character name of the field in \code{pheno} to be used as metric
for the date of end of cycle (associated with \code{pop_seasons}).
Set to NULL in order not to apply.}

\item{max_n_cycles}{(optional) Maximum number of cycles to be detected in one
season (default: Inf, meaning that all the identified cycles are kept).
If \code{pop} is provided, the cycles with the corresponding dates of peak closer
to the dates set in argument \code{pop} (for each seasons) are selected;
otherwise, the field \code{weight} of the input \code{pheno} dataset is considered
(cycles with the higher values are selected).}

\item{rm_unassigned}{(optional) Logical: should cycles which do not match with
any season (basing on the settings) be dropped from the output?
(Default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
The input data table, filtered basing on arguments and with the
addition of the field \code{season}, containing the name of each season
(one among the ones specified in argument \code{seasons}) associated to each
cycle.
If \code{seasons = NA} this field is not returned.
}
\description{
Filter detected cycles basing on dates of begin / end / peak,
or limit the number of cycles allowed for any specified season.
