# sen2rts: Build and Analyse Sentinel-2 Time Series

`{sen2rts}` is an R library which helps to extract and manage time series
from Sentinel-2 archives created with the package [sen2r](https://sen2r.ranghetti.info/).

This package is currently under development (alpha version).

The vignette ["The {sen2rts} workflows"](./articles/workflow.html) shows a simple,
reproducible use case to obtain a smoothed equally-weighted time series, 
isolate cycles and extract metrics,
showing how the currently implemented functions can be used to perform a 
common workflow.
For documentation about specific functions, see the [Reference](./reference) page
(currently examples are not provided, so refer to 
[the vignette](./articles/workflow.html) for an example of functions usage).


See [issues](https://github.com/ranghetti/sen2rts/issues) to know which 
improvements are planned for future release
(issues can not be used for assistance and questions until the package is in alpha version).
